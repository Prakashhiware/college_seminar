                    <h3>Origins and Early Development</h3>

                    align-items: center;">
                        The foundational technology behind deepfakes, deep learning and GANs (Generative
                        Adversarial Networks), began to mature around 2014. GANs, introduced by Ian Goodfellow and his
                        colleagues, were pivotal. The term "deepfake" emerged around late 2017 from a Reddit user who posted
                        manipulated pornographic videos using this technology
                        2017-2018: The term "deepfake" started gaining widespread attention. The creation of user-friendly
                        tools and software, such as FakeApp, allowed non-experts to create deepfakes, significantly
                        increasing the proliferation of deepfake content.
                        2018: High-profile examples included manipulated videos of celebrities and political figures,
                        sparking concerns over misinformation and the potential misuse of deepfakes. <img src="img1.jpeg"  height="200px"  style="border-radius: 10px;box-shadow: 2px 2px 2px 2px grey;"></div>
                    <h3>Public Awareness and Regulatory Concerns</h3>
                    2018-2019: As deepfakes grew more sophisticated and accessible, their potential for misuse in
                    misinformation, political propaganda, and cybercrime became apparent. Public awareness increased,
                    leading to various discussions on regulation and the ethical implications of such technology.
                    2019: Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter began developing policies to combat the
                    spread of deepfakes. Major incidents, such as a deepfake of Nancy Pelosi, further highlighted the
                    risks.

                    </summary>
                    AI researchers and companies developed more advanced detection techniques to combat deepfakes.
                    Initiatives like the Deepfake Detection Challenge by Facebook, Microsoft, and academic institutions
                    aimed to accelerate the development of detection tools. The rise of real-time deepfake apps, such as
                    ZAO and Reface, allowed users to create convincing deepfakes with minimal effort, demonstrating the
                    rapid advancement of the technology. Governments began to take legislative actions against malicious
                    uses of deepfakes. For instance, the United States introduced laws penalizing the creation and
                    distribution of non-consensual deepfake pornography and election-related deepfakes. Deepfake
                    technology continues to evolve, with applications expanding beyond malicious uses to entertainment,
                    education, and other sectors. Simultaneously, the development of more robust detection methods and
                    ethical guidelines remains a priority.
