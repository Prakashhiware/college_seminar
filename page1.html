        <main> <h2>Applications of Deepfakes</h2>
        
            <h3>Entertainment</h3>
           <P> Deepfakes are widely used in the entertainment industry, particularly in movies and video games. They enable filmmakers and game developers to create highly realistic visual effects. For instance, deepfake technology can digitally de-age actors, bring deceased actors back to life on screen, or even create entirely new digital characters that blend seamlessly with live actors. This not only enhances the visual experience but also opens up new creative possibilities in storytelling.</P>
         <H3>Education</H3>
        <P>In the field of education, deepfakes are used to create realistic simulations for training purposes. These simulations can be particularly useful in medical training, where realistic scenarios involving patients can help medical students and professionals practice and hone their skills without any risk. Additionally, historical figures can be brought to life for educational purposes, allowing students to interact with lifelike digital representations and gain a deeper understanding of history</P>
        <H3>Personal Use</H3>
        <P>For personal use, deepfakes are commonly found in fun apps that allow users to swap faces in images or videos. These apps, which are often used for entertainment and social media sharing, enable users to place their faces onto famous movie scenes, celebrity photos, or even their friends' and family members' pictures. This has created a new form of digital amusement, allowing users to engage with content in creative and personalized ways</P>
